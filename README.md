- As shown in the figure, the user can interact with either the local game, or the web front end in the browser.
- Matching two players will be done through a WebSocket server.
- The WebSocket server is the main communication channel between the two players while playing the game.
- At the end of each game, the local desktop game will send some statistics about the game results(the winner, score, players,.) to the webserver through an HTTP API.
- The webserver communicates with the database server to save and show the data on the site front-end.
